When thinking of backend languages, JavaScript is not the first thing that comes to mind. But why not? Why not write a backend in JavaScript? Or even a whole microservices infrastructure!
In this talk we will discuss exactly what a microservice can look like in Javascript with the addition of frameworks like Socket.IO or NestJS and how several microservices would communicate with each other. 
There is no prior knowledge of JavaScript required. Everything we show will be explained.
